Universal binary log file reader and writer
-------------------------------------------

This library allows you to create compact binary log files (and of course
parse them later) in UNIBIN format. UNIBIN log files are designed to store
tables of (mostly) numeric data without using too much space, although it can
also be used to store text if necessary.
